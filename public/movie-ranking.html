<h3>1. Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>This was the perfect ending of the 22 films. I still cry at the end. I love you 3000</p>

<h3>2. Spiderman Into the Spider-verse</h3>
<p>I actually refused t osee thsi one at first. Then I took a chance and it was amazing! The art, story, music... everything about it was amazing.
Plus there is a tie to sneaker culture, which I of course love</p>

<h3>3. Ready Player 1</h3>
<p>This movie tied so much together in a beautiful way. Iconic music and movies, a distopian-ish world, technology, love interests, and a killer plot. A homerun in my books.

<p>P.S.m3 should've been Spiderman Across the Spider-verse, but I did a different one to spread the love.</p>
